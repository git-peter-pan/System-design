WEB CRAWLER && TINY URL
design crawler
design thread-safe consumer and producer(Amazon) CAN PRACTISE URSELF
design a tinyurl CAN PRACTISE URSELF

interview : let's implement on singers

based on data: web pages--information collection --database -- information retrieval--(rank, search, recommend)
rank, search and recommand can combine into rank
if rank and recommand use different datasets, rank based on clicks, recommand based on social graph, you'd better
seperate them.

crawl:(python)
url = 'http://xxx/xxx/xxx.shtml'; 
request = urllib2.Request(url); //write a letter
response = urllib2.urlopen(request); //send the letter and get the reply
page = response.read(); // read the reply
//save the source file
webFile = open('webPage.html', 'wb')
webFile.write(page); 

interview: what is the process druing crawler

crawler: socket() -- > connect() -- > read() write() -- > close()
web server: socket() ->bind() -- >listen() -> accept() -> read /write()
similar like call center
http connection
syn - syn-ack - ack 1st

http application layer
socket abstract layer for under layers
TCP /UDP transportation layer
IP network layer
Hardware interface link layer

What is HTML
html uses a tree to represent a page
svg: scalable vector graphics(SVG)

INTERVIEW:crawl all the news of a website:
crawl all the news page
identify the list page
http://yue.ifen.com/news/list_0/0.shtml
list_0 .... can increase maybe
0.shtml can increase maybe 
regex:

ans:
import re;
 pattern = re.compile("<a href="http://yue.ifeng.com/news/detail_(.*?)"target="_blank">(.*?)</a>', re.S);
.: any character
*: zero or more 
?: zero or one
items = re.findall(patter, page);

architecture(v1)
List crawler -> links of news -> news crawler -> pages of news

Interview: crawl more page
architecture(v2)
ifen.com-                         - many ifeng.com(new crawler)
sina.com-scheduler(links of news) - many sina.com -- page of news
163.com-                          - many 163.com
Interview: drawback of this architecture
news cralwer can be used repeatly.

architecture:
many crawler 
scheduler(two strategy: list, news)
task table: task id, priority(list > url), type(page_ifen, list_163), state(done, working, new), link, 
available time(), endTime

INTERVIEWER: design a scheduler? producer and consumer model
Solution with sleep

		 	task.state = "done";
		 release(tasktable);
	else
		lock(tasktable);
		pageTable.add(page);
		release(tasktable);
end while
INTERVIEW: SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CODE
state in else wasn't set up
lock(tasktable);
task.state = "done";
release(tasktable);

INTERVIWER: DESIGN SCHEDULER WITH CONDITIONAL VARIABLE(ask frequently)
modify:
while( tasktable.find(state == new))
	cond_wait.add(cond, tasktable)
	...
tasktable.add(newtask);
con_signal(cond);// after crawler is empty

conditional variable
cond_wait(cond, mutex)
 lock(cond.threadWaitList);
 cond.threadWaitList.add(this.thread);
 release(cond.threaWaitList);

 relaese(mutex);
 block(this.thread);
 lock(mutex);

 cond_signal(cond)
 	lock(cond.threadWaitList);
 	if(cond.threadWaitlist.size() > 0) 
 		thread = cond.threadwaitlist.pop();
 		wakeup(thread);
 	relaese(cond.threadwaitlist);

How to increase visiiting speed of a webpage?

Design “instant kill/ seckilling" system
chanllenge: high qps =1k or 10k or average qps
design rate limiter: limit users rather than let the website crack

INTERVIEW : MANY users complain that htye cannot usr our radio, please do sth!
STEP1:

leadership: give expilicitly order(step by step) other than general order(find the reason)
anaysis problem 5 steps:
1.define problem, understand the problem exactly
how to define cannot use our radio: failure rate= percentage of users can't listen to music proply
= number of user who fail to play one music / number of total users
better than failure musics/ total mussics, 
focus on user
Mission: reduce failure rate

how to get the number of total users
a1: ip , not good, school will use the same ip outside(but many users);

内网：即所说的局域网，比如学校的局域网，局域网内每台计算机的IP地址在本局域网内具有互异性，是不可重复的。但两个局域网内的内网IP可以有相同的。
    外网：即互联网，局域网通过一台服务器或是一个路由器对外连接的网络，这个IP地址是惟一的。也就是说内网里所有的计算机都是连接到这一个外网IP上，通过这一个外网IP对外进行交换数据的。也就是说，一个局域网里所有电脑的内网IP是互不相同的,但共用一个外网IP。（用ipconfig/all查到的IP是你本机的内网IP；在www.ip138.com上看到的是你连接互联网所使用的IP，即外网）

a2: session(not good), a user may use differen devices,

a3: mac address, sometime cannot get the mac address, especially in mobile devices.

a1, a2 is acceptable. 
session: semi-permanent interactive information interchange, also known as a dialogue between 
two or more communicating devices, or between server and client.

cookies, session

recommand in website: cookie

shopping cart synchronize: login anynmous, put some goods in the shopping cart,
when login, these goods are put this user's shopping cart automatically
INTERVIEW: how to do that
sol1: login in set new cookie. check the old cookie has commodities, combine to the new cookies
automatically or manually.

INTERVIEW CASE 2: put commodity in mobile, put commodity in pc
usually not syn
sol: write them into database. based on userID

interview: how to notice between mobile and web browser
make state connection with server
or server listen for update commodity

INTERVIEW: how to collect the data of failure rate
check the log
log: 
a user will send a log to server when it visits our website
a user will send another log to server when it plays music

problem with this mode: 
send 2 logs
only play music log is neccessary, the server can log automatically when a user visits our website.
a user only need to send a log to server when play music

visite but not play music consider as a failure, but it's acceptable.

what is the process of playing music

broswer -> DNS(address to ip) 
 |
 server

 seeing is believing


what is the process of playing music
browser check thire cache first, if not, 
1. prepare(understand and built socket)

2.send DNS request
3.prepare dns request(if dns server didnt found asker other)
4.send dns replay 
5.process dns reply

6.send webpage request
7.prepare webpage reply
8.send webpage reply
9.process webpage

10.request music player 
11.prepare music player
12. send music player
13.process music

14. request MP3
15. prepare MP3
16. send MP3
17. play MP3

vpn, WHERE IS VPN, FROM STEP2.

where is the problem?
failure rate = 20%
= 8%(DNS) + 5%(WEB) + 2%(PLAYER) + 5%(MP3)
interview: how can we get so specific failure rate
log every step

NEXT STEP: FIND the largest number
INTERVIEW: HOW CAN WE FIND DNS FAILURE rate, if fail cannot visite website, will not send the log to ur server

has application on mobile
process of DNS
DNS is districuted system.s
1.check local hosts file(cache)
2.ask DNS Server
3.check itself or ask others
4.send ip address back

hijack DNS
127.0.0.1 urweb.com

WHY some competiros in music industry will hijack the DNS of others when a user install their 
software.
SOLUTION: hosts file analysis by our software

step 2: 
DNS server analysis by ISP(INTERVIEW service provider)
WHY CSTNET fails to update our latest DNS after we changed our server address
Solution
 make a phone call

step4:
send ip address back(hijacked by middleman);


after solving that, other increases failure rates
WHY: other increase because more sucess in DNS
WHY STILL 1%, 
reason1: some company don't allow to visited these website
reason2: greatwall block

fix the web problem
solution 1: reverse proxy with more servers: load balance
solution 2: reduce the size of webpage
simplify content rewrite the js code, save 10%
compress/merge images(reduce request times, dont need header every time), from 300 dpi to 72dpi, save 40%
lazy load, load visable part first, when scroll to the invisible part then load, save 70%
preload

solution 3: more cacheable pages.
change dynamic webpage into static webpage.
??proxy vs reverse proxy
http://blog.csdn.net/m13666368773/article/details/8060481
after that
web failure 4% reason: many users will cose the webpage as soon as they open it.

INTERVIEW why increase load speed can help solve failure rate:
ans: they will close if load speed is too slow, usually 3 seconds.

fix the MP3 problem
ndx: reverse proxy, application layer

process anaysis:
step13, failed to send the request
step14, network 3% timeout 0.01%
step15, fail to establish connection 0.01%, fail to find mp3 file 1%
step16 network errors 0.01% timeout 1%
step17 fail to play

cdn???: content delivery network
ping all cdn and find the best one

cannot play flash
solution: develop HTML5 player

INTERVIEW: HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE SOLVED THESE PROBLEMS?
ANS: measure number of daily complains. (user oriented!!!)

INTERVIEW : WILL this fixation increase our daily active users?
can we measure daily active users every day? no, affect by too many factors.

one day retention rate
the number of users visited on both dayx and day(x+1)/the number of users on day(x)



rate limiter:limit qps
INTERVIEW LIMIT qps = 5;
sol: the gap between two request >= 1/5s
too restrict 0.0, 0,2, 0,3(rejected)
INTERVIEW five in a second
algorithm of time-bucket
0s 5buckets
1s 5 buckets
Acquire() 
	s = GetCurrentSecond();
	if(mCounterp[s] >= 5) 
		return false;
	else 
		mCounter[s]++;
		return true;

INTERVIWER: do it with database
what if 6th request in this second? drop(limit) or wait(others)


Acquire() 
	s = GetCurrentSecond();
	if(mCounterp[s] >= 5) 
		return false;
	else 
		mCounter[s]++;
		return true;
		counter = Database.get(s);
		if(count != null && count == 5) 
			return false;
		else 
			database.increase(s,1);
			database.expire(s,1);//in order to delete in next second

INTERVIEW: Save space
algorithm of one-bucket
Acquire() 
	s = GetCurrentSecond();
	if(s != mPreSecond)
		mcounter = 0;
		mPreSecond = currentSecond;
	if(mCounterp[s] >= 5) 
		return false;
	else 
		mCounter[s]++;
		return true;

Bad case:
1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1
6 requests in 2.1-1.2 = 0.9s;
solution: sliding window

Acquire() 
	s = GetCurrentSecond();
	preFifthTime = mRequestList[mRequestList.size() - 5];
	if(currentSecond - preFifthSecond > 1) 
		mRequestList.append(currentTime);
		return true;
	else 
		return false;

Problem list get very long after a period of time
solution: loop array or queue(push or pop)

Acquire() 
	s = GetCurrentSecond();
	if(currentTime - musicRequestList[mPtr] > 1)
		mRequestList[mPtr] = currentTime;
		mPtr = (mPtr+1)%5;
		return true;

calculate word appearance/inverted index/anagrams with MapReduce

Three Musketeers of Google
MapReduce, BigTable, GFS

google 
What is the layer of search engine?

data stream
10^12-15 pages
save them(how to save, how to read and write);
PageRank
Application 1, 2, 3
algorithm(MapReduce) ( some part connect direct to file(GFS))
Data model(BigTable)
File(GFS)

How to save a file?

disk structure, see ppt p11
in linux, everything is a file
in basic system, write and read in continous space, faster

How to save a large file
cannot index(index is very large);

sol: chunks(64MB)
drawback, if the file is small, waste space

file is larger then hard drive.
advantage: reduce the size of metadata.
reduce the traffic

Interview: how to save a extra large file
one master + many chunkServers

disadvantage:
Any change of the diskoffset a chunk in a chunkserver need to notify the master

How to reduce the traffic
the master don't recort the diskoffset of a chunk,
just store which chunkserver
chunserver itself store the diskoffset

Advantage: 
reduce the sie of the metadata in master 
reduce the traffic between master and chunkserver

How to identify whether a chunk on the disk is broken?
key point 
1 chunk = a list of blocks
1 block = 64 kb
each block has a checksum
1 checksum = 32bit
the size of checksum of 1T file
1T/64KB*32bit = 64MB

It will compare its checksum when it reads a block to check correct or not

系统要为错误而设计

how to avoid the loos of data when a chunkserve is down/fail?
Key point 
replicate the chunks and put the in 3 chunkservers.

how to decide the checksum bits
how many replications : 3
how to select chunkservers of a chunk?
 server with below-average disk space utilization
 limited number of "recent" creation
 across racks 2+1 (2 in CA datacenter) (1 in WA datacenter)

 How to recover when a chunk is broken?
 ask master 
 some details:
 1.send message to master that a chunk is broken
 2.chunk delete the broken chunk and 
 3.get reply from master, know where is the other chunks
 4.visite the closest on server to ask the chun
 5. get chunk back
 6. notice master have recover the chunk
 7.chunk add that server back to index

How to find whether a chunkserver is down?

send message to master periodly.
1 min(ofen) or 10min
chunk server send heartbeat
master waits until 5min and know that missing heartbeat is broken

How to recover data when a chunkserver is down?
key point:
repair priority is based on the number of replications
what if they are the same
earlier , higher priority 

How to avoid hot spot?
hot spot: frequently visited in a short time

chunck stats
chunk00, access frequency = 100;
server stats
chunkserver01, free space = 21%, free bandwidth = 15%;
replicate a chunk into more replications when it is busy
fill the chunkserver with more space and more bandwidth
will delete these chun after the hot period is gone
How to read from file??


Master load is too much?

How to write into a file?
Application(GFS client) < -- > GFS master
client tells the master that : where is (chunk, 2ef0);
master replay that the primary is CS3, the replica are CS0 and CS5.
client dont need to know too much about the lower layer
master needs to be simple as much as possible
so find one of 3 chunkservers to write the file

3.1 cache (2ef0);
send to closest chunk server
to chunkserver 0;
3.2 cache()
 send to chunkserver 3
 3.3 cache(2ef0);
 need ack indicates that those data has been store in memory
 then application start to find primary chunkserver, and ask him to 
 write these data into hard driver.
 primary tells others to wirte into hard driver
 get 2 acks
 send ack back to client.

 WHAT IF primary is down when cache ?
 dont handle that , let client himself to handle, choose to retry or not.

 cache 完之后还不能访问数据
 3 chunks write are successful then notice client succeed, else failed



BigTable
How to support lookup and range query on a file?
table = A list of sorted<key, value>

How to save a large table

Tablet2, lastKeyOfTablet2, address2

Tablet0
...
a, sangpo
c, flyer
 
 a table = a list of tablets
 tablet = a list of sorted <key, value>

 How to save an extra-large table?
 morelevels, 3 levels

 How to write into a table?
 memTable: memory table, pointer
 memTable: insert into memtable first, make sure the speed.
 A tablet = memTable + a list of SSTables(64M);

 What if memTable is too large?(full)
 if full, create a new SSTable, dump the data to that SSTable.

 How to avoid system failure.
 a tablet = memTable + a list of SSTables + log

 inside a sstable, it's sorted
 what about among sstables? may be not sorted.

 How to read data?
a read need to ask all sstables and memtable
each sstable needs to use Disk search to find the element.

How to read data fast??
a sstable = a list of sorted <key, value> = a list of 64k blocks + index
indices are pre-loaded into memory
read fast by 
	use indices by identify the place in disk

READ FASTER????
bloomfilter

a sstable = a list of sorted <key, value> = a list of 64k blocks + index
+bloomfilter

How to build bloom filter
foo two hash value
set them as 1

How to save a table into GFS?


What is the logical view of table?
3d table, time line
whey they need time line, crawler different version(time) of webpage

GFS LIKE linux OS
bigtable like MYSQL

INTERVIEWER: how to transform logic into physical
key = string(row, column, time);

bigtable architecture
bigtables are in the memory, dont need hard driver. 
tablets are in the memory.

MapReduce
for 1TB <key, value> data, how to compute 
 	appearances of words
 	inverted index
 	anagrams

 What is map and reduce?
 map: disasssemble
 reduce: reassemble

 input -> split -> map -> shuffle -> reduce -> finalize

 Interviwer: calculate word's number of appearance.

  Map(string key, string value)
  //key: the id of a line
  //value: the content of the line
  for each word in value
  	outputTemp(word,1);

  reduce(String key, list valueList)
  //key: the name of a word
  //valueList: the appearances of this word. 
  int sum = 0;
  for value in value list,
  sum += value; 

  OutputFinal(key, sum);

 Interview: Build inverted index
 calculate anagrams with mapreduce

 What is architecture of MapReduce
 differnt master

 only local write and 6.write are in the hard drive
 LOCAL write will be clear after finishing the task
 fork: create workers

 big data anaysis
 hash, bit map, tire, b tree

 Interviewer: find top-100 ips in 1T logs of (id, timestamp, IP);
